          <h2>On Randomness and Predicting the Markets</h2>
          <p>The financial markets are a reflection of (primarily) human decision-making, and the decision making of algorithms developed by humans, 
            and appear random. However, if human decision-making itself is not random, this implies that markets are not truly random either. 
            So the question becomes: are humans (and human decision-making) truly random?</p>
            <p>We look at a thought experiment: if you collected a large random sample of asking people to pick a very random number between 1 
              and 100, what would the distribution of the results look like? In theory, if human decision-making was truly random, one would 
              expect a close-to-uniform distribution, since each number should have the same probability of being chosen. In fact, this 
              experiment has been done many times on a large sample of people, and very often the distribution is not uniform, but centered 
              at the number 37, meaning 37 was a number that was consistently chosen more than other numbers.

              - https://www.upworthy.com/pick-a-random-number-between-100-you-probably-chose-37-and-there-s-a-big-reason-for-that</p>
            <p>Why is this? Because people tend to have the narrow, and predictable, perception that the number “37” is a very good candidate 
              as being randomly-generated based on a few characteristics of this number. First of all, 37 is prime which inclines more people 
              to choose it. People perceive even numbers, or even worse, numbers divisible by 10, as too predictable and unlikely to be random. 
              Most people also dislike going to the extremes (such as 1 or 100) when asked to choose a random number, because they perceive that 
              a random process/random number generator would never generate an extreme number at the outer bounds. Using this reasoning, 
              the available set of numbers that “appear” to be randomly generated quickly gets narrowed down to a few candidates. 
              37 happens to look the best and the most random out of all these candidates, thus why it’s chosen most often. 
              As you can expect, numbers like 1 or 100 are very rarely chosen at all.</p>
            <p>This is a very simple setting where we easily deduced the reasoning behind a majority of peoples’ reasoning and decision-making 
              process. However, there were very few factors to consider in this example, and only 100 possible outcomes. In the financial markets, 
              the number of factors to consider and possible outcomes are exponentially larger. Nevertheless, the same concept applies to 
              markets in that the events that occur are not truly driven by a random process, but instead are driven by a (more complex) 
              set of human-reasoning and decision making processes, where humans cannot fully process or understand and are ultimately forced 
              to create abstractions like probability to compensate for their ignorance. The question then becomes, how can we best approximate 
              certain events given limited information? As humans are not intelligent enough to deduce the data-generating process behind the 
              omplexities and madness of human decision-making, a more powerful form of intelligence is necessary to recognize and learn these 
              processes.</p>
            <p>Randomness itself does not truly exist. It is an abstraction created as a result of human ignorance, in a complex setting with 
              a large number of both impacting factors and results. </p>
            <p>The market is not random. It looks random. It looks random because everyone has their own unique systems and timing for trading. 
              However, markets are not truly random, because if you had enough of the right data, then you can 100% accurately predict 
              how markets will move. It’s the same concept as a coin toss. A coin toss is thought to be random by nature. However, 
              if you had the data of the force applied to the coin when flipped, the gravity of the location of the coin toss, the mass 
              and size of the coin, etc. then you can 100% predict how the coin flip will land. In such case, a coin flip in the real world 
              is not truly random, just as financial markets in the real world is not truly random. They are only thought to be random because 
              of how complex the dynamics are and the large amount of different factors influencing the outcome of financial markets. 
              The only problem is collecting all of the necessary data to 100% accurately model financial markets, which is impossible 
              and impractical in the real world because of, just a few examples, different investors trading infrastructure, events going on, 
              things affecting trading, different trading strategies and algorithms used by different traders, and the list goes on, etc. 
              Theoretically, if one could come to collect and possess all of these relevant data regarding all market participants, then 
              they could with 100% accuracy predict the exact movements of the financial markets, down to a tick level.</p>
            <p>When you think about it, how many things in the real world and universe truly occur by pure chance and probability, 
              and are unrelated/unaffected by any other external factors or forces? How many things (Random Variables) happen based 
              on pure and complete randomness? A coin toss, in theory, is the epitome of probability and chance, but as previously discussed, 
              not even a coin toss is purely random in the real world.</p>
            <p>Very few things in the universe are truly purely random or occur by probability/chance. The entire basis of quantum physics is 
              that things occur by probability and that things happen completely randomly in the world, and there is no such model that can 
              accurately 100% predict what will happen. Einstein rejected this theory, and famously said “God does not play dice with the universe.” 
              The same concept can be applied to financial markets: Qian Capital believes that “God does not play dice with the markets.”</p>
            <p>So how are market movements created? What external factors cause movements in the markets, how are markets set up, and what exact data 
              would you need to collect (theoretically) to 100% predict market movements?</p>
            <p>The exchanges are set up to facilitate for any person to participate in buying or selling shares with each other. 
              Everyone has their own reason for buying or selling certain stocks and the reason is irrelevant to how the market moves; 
              the exchanges are simply a platform that shows the bids and asks that market participants are willing to buy or sell at. 
              And the prices in the market reflects exactly that: the trading activity of buying and selling between participants.</p>
          <h2>On Randomness and Probability</h2>
          <p>Randomness exists as an abstraction due to the lack of information to predict events with any degree of accuracy or consistency. 
            A coin flip may seem random but is actually not random. If you had exact information about the coin’s shape, size, weight, 
            surrounding air friction, gravity, and force used to throw the coin, etc, then you can predict with a degree of certainty and 
            consistency exactly how the coin will land. Same thing for card shuffling; if you know the exact starting positions of each card 
            in the deck, how many times it was shuffled and which cards were shuffled, then you can predict with a degree of certainty and 
            consistency exactly what the new order of the cards will be in the shuffled deck.</p>
          <p>Something that may be more random (insofar as current science understands) is the movement of molecules and atoms which appear 
            much more random. However, even this is a topic for much debate among physicists as the great Albert Einstein believed that this 
            process too should be deterministic and can be modeled somehow, rather than a model of probabilities.</p>
          <p>The financial markets and stock price movements are not random. If you had exact information about every market participant’s 
            strategy, their positions, their alphas, what they are looking to trade each day and how much, their execution algo, results of 
            any major market events and major news, then you can predict with almost exact certainty how the market will move. This is of 
            course impossible because that data is private and impossible to collect. However it demonstrates that the randomness of the 
            financial markets stems from the uncertainty and randomness of the market participants actions. However, to win money in the markets, 
            100% certainty of market movements is not required. As long as you have greater than a 50% certainty consistently, then that is good 
            enough to make money in the markets. Therefore, less accurate and precise information and data is needed which can be much easily 
            collected.</p>
          <p>For example, is it possible to use a smaller set of data that captures a great amount of information (i.e. 51%) of the data previously 
            described to exactly model the markets? Methods like autoencoders and PCA will create entirely new datasets from original whole 
            and complete datasets and create a much smaller set of features while retaining a large amount of the original information.</p>
          <p>If we can identify what this data is, collect the data, and model it, then we can consistently win the financial markets and 
            reduce the effect of “randomness” (which just represents uncertainty of the actions of other market participants).</p>
          <p>In a sense, probability can be thought of as an abstraction to describe, explain, and model the phenomenon of the world. 
            It is an abstraction created by humans because there is our knowledge and complexity are limited and there is no other way 
            to mathematically measure and model the complex systems of the world and the universe. That does not mean that a complex 
            system to model the dynamics of the universe does not exist. It just means that it is too complex for humans to understand 
            and mode accurately and precisely, and therefore humans must create an abstraction as a substitute. This is probability.</p>
          <p>As for how particles behave at a quantum level, only God knows the underlying process that govern their behavior. 
            However, while financial markets and market data look random, they are in fact is not. Jim Simons probably understood 
            this deeply and not fall victim to the common misperception of randomness, which is why he and RenTech was able to be 
            capitalize on the markets and become so successful. As Jim Simons said, if you had enough of the necessary data, you could 
            find repeating patterns that truly give you a competitive edge. The only problem is that it’s practically infeasible and 
            impossible to collect all the necessary data to do that.</p>
          <p>So in summary, the challenge in quantitative trading and finance is: given the limited amount of resources/data/information 
            you have, how do you take what you have a build something (a model, system, strategy, etc.) that is correct most of the time 
            (correct at least 51% of the time) to predict the financial markets? With the limited amount of information that each trader/market 
            participant has, nobody can consistently 100% accurately predict the markets. However, it may be possible to collect a subset 
            of all relevant data/information and build something that is partially accurate in modeling the market patterns and behavior.</p>
